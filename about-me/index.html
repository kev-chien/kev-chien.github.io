        <p>Hi! Some things about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <!--
            <li>I was born and raised in Taiwan and landed luckily in the amazing school <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> as an EECS major.</li>
            <li>When I'm not learning new technical concepts or building projects for school or for fun, I enjoy making music. Primary instruments: guitar, voice, violin. </li>
            <li>I became Christian in college, a life choice that I attribute one part to logically becoming convinced and another part to having experienced God's love from the wonderful people of <a href="http://klesis.net">Klesis</a>.</li>
            <li>I'm part of PiE (Pioneers in Engineering). We provide robotics education to underserved high school students in the Bay Area.</li>
            -->
            <li>Currently an EECS major at UC Berkeley <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu">College of Engineering.</a></li>
            <li>Groups I'm in: <a href="http://klesis.net">Klesis Christian Fellowship</a>, <a href="http://pioneers.berkeley.edu">Pioneers in Engineering</a></li>
            <li>Interests (technical): software development, full-stack, data science</li>
            <li>Interests (non-technical): musicals, playing music badly but joyfully, big questions in life</li>
